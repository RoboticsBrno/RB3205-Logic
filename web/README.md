# About Logic

Logic is an universal programmable toy designed for teaching programming
designed at [Robotárna](https://helceletka.cz/robotarna).

Logic resembles a game console. It has 105 RGB LEDs that can serve as display, it
has numerous buttons and buzzer. Under the hood it is powered by the ESP32
microcontroller.

The kids, well to be honest; not only them, can create custom games and they can
learn programming. It is even possible to run multiplayer games as the on board
processor features both, WiFi and Bluetooth 4.
