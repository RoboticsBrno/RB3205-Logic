# About Logic

Logic is a universal programmable toy designed for teaching programming
developed at [Robotárna](https://helceletka.cz/robotarna).

Logic resembles a game console. It has 105 RGB LEDs that can serve as a display, it
has numerous buttons and a buzzer. Under the hood, it is powered by the ESP32
microcontroller.

Kids (well, not only them) can create custom games and
learn programming while doing so. It is even possible to run multiplayer games as the on-board
processor features both, WiFi and Bluetooth 4.

This project was prepared for [Robotic Camp 2021](https://robotickytabor.cz/) ­–
the page is available, however, in Czech. You will find more project there. You
can also see our [GitHub](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno) for find out more
about our other projects.
